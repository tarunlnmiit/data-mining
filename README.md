# Announcement: The next class starts at 15:00. Please come early.

## Download this notebook to generate your own cluster heatmaps https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/cluster_heatmaps_and_validation.ipynb

## Uploaded iso accuracy lines https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/iso_accuracy_lines.ipynb

### Vote for questions/concepts to be discussed on the last day. You may include questions from the lecture, exercises, or the assessment tests. https://forms.gle/s8AEVEcpkPDpW9iM9

### Uploaded exercise 9 https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/finding_optimal_k.ipynb

### Uploaded exercise 8. For the calculation of cohesion and separation, follow the steps shown in the notebook. Please do not normalize the distances. Follow the exact formulae and steps shown in the notebook https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/cluster_validation.ipynb The values are confirmed correct.

### IMPORTANT: For the computation of the Silhouette coefficient in task 9.1, please calculate b as average distance to the points of the nearest cluster (just like in the book) and not as average distance to the points of all other clusters as shown in the slides. This is confirmed to be correct. https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/silhouette_score.ipynb ALSO, please calculate the overall clustering silhouette coefficient as average over all point silhouette values, as shown here in the notebook. In the slides, the overall clustering silhouette coefficient is calculated as average cluster silhouette coefficient which doesn't take different cluster sizes into account.
