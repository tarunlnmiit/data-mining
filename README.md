### Uploaded exercise 8. For the calculation of cohesion and separation, follow the steps shown in the notebook. Please do not normalize the distances. Follow the exact formulae and steps shown in the notebook https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/cluster_validation.ipynb The values are confirmed correct.

### Uploaded half of exercise 9. For the computation of the Silhouette coefficient in task 9.1, please calculate b as average distance to the points of the nearest cluster (just like in the book) and not as average distance to the points of all other clusters as shown in the slides. This is confirmed to be correct. https://github.com/tchanda90/data-mining/blob/master/notebooks/silhouette_score.ipynb

### Monday is a holiday so no exercise

### For the third short assessment, anything that has been discussed in the lecture until then and anything from the exercise up to sheet 9 is relevant.
